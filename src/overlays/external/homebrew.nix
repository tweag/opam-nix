# Map from homebrew package names to nixpkgs packages.
# To add a new package:
# 1. Find the package in nixpkgs:
#   * Use https://search.nixos.org/packages or `nix search` to find the package by name or description;
#   * Use https://mynixos.com/ or `nix-index`/`nix-locate` to find the package by files contained therein;
# 2. If some changes to the package are needed to be compatible with the homebrew one, make an override in the let binding below;
# 3. Add it to the list. Keep the quotation marks around the homebrew package name, even if not needed, and sort the list afterwrads.
